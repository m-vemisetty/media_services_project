179749	ALS Classroom in Library	We received a phone call about the ALS Class room located in the Library not having working sound. When we got there we noticed that the hdmi cable that was supposed to be used for laptops had been plugged into the computer. After looking into the issue further we came to the conclusion that the website the video was trying to be played off of had a bad media player and was causing the audio issues. We solved this issue by having having a laptop be plugged in and playing the video through an hdmi and AUX cord. We tested to make sure the sound could be played through youtube and other sources and it worked fine.

To help you comply, we   are introducing a new audience setting in YouTube Studio   <https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFnwnKXxM4Q-jKHEoPHlZHosGjefsnoWTTrDcW4p6QtxZkbKA5uLTkRZ0lgr34K6MqPDFGpq3pb2sBEqu8bPDfzWToFaQrOKT6fV8m7VVHWPPzXdPl6ncGmuGZC0kAjwL_hNQQO6vYbYqSnjYXJ8civUeg>.Depending on the amount of made for kids content on your channel, you can   set your audience at either the channel level or the video level. For those   who are setting at the channel level, it is just one click.These changes are required as part of a settlement with the US Federal   Trade Commission (FTC) and NY Attorney General, and will help you comply   with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and/or other   applicable laws.We know that these changes won’t be easy for some creators, and that this   required change is going to take some time getting used to. But these are   important steps to take to ensure compliance with the law.Please read more below to understand your legal obligations and the impact   these choices may have on your channel.What is changing?Starting today, all creators are required to mark their content as made for   kids or not made for kids in YouTube Studio.Starting in January: we will limit the data we collect on made for kids   content to comply with the law. This means we will disable personalized ads   on this content (which affects revenue for creators making content for   kids), as well as certain features like comments, notifications and others.   Note: You may see some small changes as we experiment and refine our   systems over the next few months.For a list of affected features, go here   <https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFnwnKXzDjVYCE4LScFww1t-InahOCtWO71kY-XYyEozFbhAdkOxZqPkkN3ddx2JZjesWM_auo8ayk-ahLNRcqi7E1WEUXB-53FCJq1cDRY69f-2Ab7I1JOYtuP9JFDulXoEAzAyn_R4T9QchwmaXKJNeQ>.Why is this happening?These changes are required as part of a settlement with the US Federal   Trade Commission (FTC) and NY Attorney General, and will help you comply   with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and/or other   applicable laws.Regardless of your location, we are required to ask you to set your videos   as made for kids if they fall into that category, please make these   settings as soon as possible.We’ll also use machine learning systems to help us find content that is   clearly made for kids. But do not rely on our systems to set content for   you -- like all automated systems, ours are not perfect.If you don’t set your content or if we detect error or abuse, we may set   your audience for you. If you fail to set your content accurately you may   face compliance issues with the FTC or other authorities, and we may take   action on your YouTube account.What is “made for kids” content?We cannot provide specific legal advice, but according to the FTC’s   guidance on COPPA, a video is child directed (which we call “made for   kids”) if:- It is directed to children as the primary audience (e.g. videos for   preschoolers).- It is directed to children but children are a secondary audience (e.g.   cartoon video that primarily targets  teenagers but is also intended for   younger kids).Learn more about the factors that determine if your content is considered   as made for kids here  <https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFnwnKWwBrkiWhDN51hpmkxnhmDVYHJuXUuXg8XCQxlI8SgCbo0lgo-ESXkLp22a-Kpj6Muwu8unAYmNHldTLuN8WCvjlZG0GpB_Mb0MAMDxOG7PXUEaDOjjfRXElKpPmw1hoZo>.We know this won’t be easy for some creators, and that this required change   is going to take some getting used to.

Since the class starts right when we open we might need to either set this up the night before or have someone from IT that is in earlier in the day to set this up.

We will need to setup the presentation inside but in a location so as many people as possible can see. We would also request that speakers are put outside as we expect we will overflow outside this space as well. You’re the experts but maybe 4 speakers inside (or two large) and two outside?On another note - Just a radical idea? Is there a way just to use the large monitor in that space.

170185	Problem with Computer Display in Alumni Hall 112	"Hello,I am teaching English 335 in Alumni 112 on T/Th from 9:35-10:50.  This morning (the first day of the class), I could not get either the Cal Lutheran website or (especially) Blackboard to display properly from the classroom monitor, let alone the projection screen. On the classroom (desk) monitor at the front corner of the room, the website is never fully displayed at once.  After an attempt at adjusting it, I could get most of it up, but in tiny print. In Blackboard for my course (English 335) I could not see or find any of the purple navigational menu buttons, which are usually displayed on the left-hand side of the screen.  None of the content I had loaded to the class seemed to be there, although when I returned to my office, I could easily find it there on my office monitor, and of course, I could also find the purple navigational buttons on the left side of the screen.It may be that I don't know how to adjust the smart touch monitor so that it displays everything; however, I have never had this problem with a classroom monitor before.  Please advise me what to do, and let me know if the problem can be fixed.  I tried three different internet browsers:  Chrome, Mozilla, and Internet Explorer.  Not one of them showed me the content that I had placed on my course Blackboard page yesterday and this morning, and so I could not put any of that content on the projection screen to show the students in my class.Thank you!Jim* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *James Arthur Bond, Ph.D.Associate Professor of EnglishCalifornia Lutheran University60 W.

I know it was a class and not booked through events directly but the reservation was in ASTRA, so not sure why we were not notified about a projector not working when there was a class scheduled.

Unfortunately this has not been the first weekend issue, we have had issues with doors being locked before 6pm, double bookings, etc.Hopefully we can all work together to prevent any future issues.Please note the Sodexo staff who set up the meals were very accommodating and Jon Urango helped with the AC in the alternate rooms all weekend as well.

168733	Updates to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy	"Hi Carlos,We’re constantly looking for ways to improve the Dropbox experience. This year we’ve announced new features[1] , partnerships[2] , and the acquisition of HelloSign[3] . To support these improvements, we’ve made a few updates to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Here’s a summary of the key additions:   - Terms of Service . On June 11, we unveiled the new Dropbox. Our mission is to offer a robust collaboration workspace that helps users find, retrieve, organize, and prioritize their files, collaborate with others, and stay focused on their most important work. To better align with that mission and the new Dropbox, our revised Terms outline that our Services provide “features like commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews, optical character recognition (OCR), easy sorting and organization, and personalization to help reduce busywork.” We’ve also revised our beta terms to include a confidentiality provision and to allow Dropbox to solicit feedback from beta participants. - Privacy Policy . We’ve updated our Privacy Policy to include more details on what personal data we collect and how we use it. For instance, our Privacy Policy now explains how Dropbox shares data with companies that it acquires (like HelloSign) and other ecosystem partners[4] that offer integrations for Dropbox users. We’ve also revised our Privacy Shield attestation so that data transfers from the UK to the US will continue to be covered by our Privacy Shield certification if the UK leaves the European Union. You can read the full Terms of Service[5] and Privacy Policy[6] , which will go into effect on September 24th, 2019. You can also find our previous Terms here[7] . For more details, visit our Help Center[8] .Thanks!- The Dropbox Team[1]: https://www.dropbox.com/l/AAD4xMxY2EuM7M-Dqv591D3UVr-4omR2emM[2]: https://www.dropbox.com/l/AACJUkOUiB-OuTVO2GeYwun6bPKfjRZaPkQ[3]: https://www.dropbox.com/l/AACsjRyRNfYEsCPYBjrUqiJIxzwhDovffT8[4]: https://www.dropbox.com/l/AAB3DFgcGE6aVB6uN0wY-5OKIPxXfwKTCrE[5]: https://www.dropbox.com/l/AABGCzuXBGDfxl2NH0hM7kvlFSjNldR-zzg/terms2019[6]: https://www.dropbox.com/l/AADUo4ScEj7A3VPFshcYL-ncjjh9UgepW2Y/privacy2019[7]: https://www.dropbox.com/l/AADEegHyhpD_u3ErHVVbswWqfvwgGT5iG-E/terms[8]: https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/security/terms-service-privacy-policy"

But when will they remodel again?Many successful remodelers have discovered there is profit to be made in handyman work. Some even have separate divisions that only do handyman work — with most of the work performed for previously satisfied remodeling customers!The HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator contains page after page of items that will give you accurate costs for virtually any small job your customer wants!Every item contains a full description and is broken down to exact labor cost, material cost, total cost and sales price to the customer.https://hometechonline.com/product/handyman-maintenance-repair-cost-estimator/Visit our website to make your hassle free order today.Order Today!

In the past we'verented gear packages that included: cameras Canon C100, media cards,lenses, sound equipment like boom mics, cables, headsets, and tripods.We were wondering if you guys have enough gear similar or equivalent thatwe might be able to put on hold for the end of September. Right now we'repossibly having 5-7 groups of teams participating, so possibly 5-7 sets ofequipment. Not every team is going to use every set, but we want to have acouple of sets ready for teams to use if they want to.Thank you for your help and hope to hear back soon.Sincerely,Alejandro Guzman"

This comprehensive system is laid out the same as the HomeTech Publishing Remodeling & Renovation Cost Estimator with the same 25 divisions from Plans and Permits to final Clean-up.A major feature of the HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator is that most of the items show the cost for a minimum sized job as well as costs for the same work in a large quantity. As all hands-on contractors know, there is preparation work required on every job — and sometimes on a smaller job there will be more time spent on preparation than actually performing the work!Every contractor has customers who want them to perform small jobs for them — replacing sidewalks, repairing steps, installing locksets, fixing leaky plumbing — but until now there was not a good way to price this work AND MAKE MONEY!When you complete a medium to large scale remodeling project and satisfy the homeowner, you create a customer for life. But when will they remodel again?Many successful remodelers have discovered there is profit to be made in handyman work. Some even have separate divisions that only do handyman work — with most of the work performed for previously satisfied remodeling customers!The HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator contains page after page of items that will give you accurate costs for virtually any small job your customer wants!Every item contains a full description and is broken down to exact labor cost, material cost, total cost and sales price to the customer.https://hometechonline.com/product/handyman-maintenance-repair-cost-estimator/Visit our website to make your hassle free order today.Order Today!

No matter how thorough your home inspection or how vast your technical knowledge, if your customer and their agent don't easily understand your report, you're out of business!HomeTech Publishing would like to introduce you to the most widely used and respected home inspection report in the industry today - The HomeTech Building Analysis Report.Every year over 100,000 home inspections are written using this easy to use, easy to understand report - that's more reports than our two biggest competitors sell combined! Our report is 20 pages long with 3 NCR copies. And unlike other systems that are comprised of loose sets of NCR paper, the HomeTech Building Analysis Report comes fully assembled and covered with a glossy, full color cover.The BAR has nine tabbed sections that follow the natural flow of the home inspection and also includes four different pre-inspection agreement forms to choose from.* Summary* Structural and Basement* Heating and Cooling* Plumbing and Bathroom* Electrical and Kitche* Interior and Attic* Roofing System and Exterior* Grounds* Remarks** View Sample Pages (https://hometechpublishing.com/skin/frontend/default/theme196k/images/building_analysis_report_sample.pdf?utm_source=HomeTech+Publishing+List&utm_campaign=1a0a063d74-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_04_09_03_48_COPY_09&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d95cf6c7c1-1a0a063d74-315908945)Custom Branded Cover Design & Company Information ImprintingHomeTech Publishing can fully customize your BAR cover graphics and pre-inspection agreement page for your business.

The hotel will provide an LCD projector with screen and one standard wired microphone in the general session room.  We will provide any additional A/V equipment required. Once the agenda and breakouts are finalized, we will have a better idea of the equipment needed. I've copied Michael Gagliardo, FEC Chair, who can provide you with that information.Please note the time change from last year.  As such, you will probably only need to stay at the hotel on Wednesday night this year.We will provide additional details soon - just wanted to make sure that this is on your calendar, and that you will be available to assist.Thank you!Judy BeaulieuAcademic Affairs Executive Assistant[cid:image001.png@01CFB187.8093B9A0]60 West Olsen Road #1400  |  Thousand Oaks, CA 91360Phone: (805) 493-3145  |  Fax: (805) 493-3456CalLutheran.edu[attachment name=image003.png]"	"<note date=""7/8/19 10:51 am"" author=""cvelasqu-tech"" type=""tech"" time=""0"" rate=""No Charge"">Hell Judy,Thank you for letting us know the dates for Faculty Retreat, I added the dates in our calendar.

But when will they remodel again?Many successful remodelers have discovered there is profit to be made in handyman work. Some even have separate divisions that only do handyman work — with most of the work performed for previously satisfied remodeling customers!The HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator contains page after page of items that will give you accurate costs for virtually any small job your customer wants!Every item contains a full description and is broken down to exact labor cost, material cost, total cost ,sales price to the customer, and hours required for each line item!https://hometechonline.com/product/handyman-maintenance-repair-cost-estimator/Pre-Order Today for only $99 with coupon code!

This comprehensive system is laid out the same as the HomeTech Publishing Remodeling & Renovation Cost Estimator with the same 25 divisions from Plans and Permits to final Clean-up.A major feature of the HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator is that most of the items show the cost for a minimum sized job as well as costs for the same work in a large quantity. As all hands-on contractors know, there is preparation work required on every job — and sometimes on a smaller job there will be more time spent on preparation than actually performing the work!Every contractor has customers who want them to perform small jobs for them — replacing sidewalks, repairing steps, installing locksets, fixing leaky plumbing — but until now there was not a good way to price this work AND MAKE MONEY!When you complete a medium to large scale remodeling project and satisfy the homeowner, you create a customer for life. But when will they remodel again?Many successful remodelers have discovered there is profit to be made in handyman work. Some even have separate divisions that only do handyman work — with most of the work performed for previously satisfied remodeling customers!The HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator contains page after page of items that will give you accurate costs for virtually any small job your customer wants!Every item contains a full description and is broken down to exact labor cost, material cost, total cost ,sales price to the customer, and hours required for each line item!https://hometechonline.com/product/handyman-maintenance-repair-cost-estimator/Pre-Order Today for only $99 with coupon code!

Some even have separate divisions that only do handyman work — with most of the work performed for previously satisfied remodeling customers!The HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator contains page after page of items that will give you accurate costs for virtually any small job your customer wants!Every item contains a full description and is broken down to exact labor cost, material cost, total cost and sales price to the customer.https://hometechonline.com/product/handyman-maintenance-repair-cost-estimator/Visit our website to make your hassle free order today.Order Today!

162919	ERPA Congresses on Education 2019_Final Call	"ERPA Congresses on Education 2019_Final CallERPA International Congresses on Education 2018[1] www.erpacongress.comDear Colleague,It is with great pleasure to inform you about the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 that will be held in Istanbul / Turkey from 28 June to 1 July 2018 ( [2] www.erpacongress.com ). We hope that the conference will enable you to share your research with an international research community and to engage in discussion about the current issues in the field of education. We want you to remember ERPA International Congresses on Education as a place where you discussed the issues and questions that count for your research, renewed relations with your colleagues and made contacts that helped you to develop new directions in your work. Congress languages are English and Turkish.Ten branch congresses will be held concurrently in ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018; - ERPA International Educational Sciences Congress - ERPA International Science and Mathematics Education Congress - ERPA International Social Sciences Education Congress - ERPA International Health and Sports Science Education Congress - ERPA International Music and Fine Arts Education Congress - ERPA International Special Education Congress - ERPA International Computer Education and Instructional Technology Congress - ERPA International Language Education Congress - ERPA International Management of Education Congress - ERPA International Engineering and Architecture Education CongressWhile registering the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 you will be asked to choose the one that is related to your field of study. The main purpose in incorporating ten congresses within the scope of ERPA International Congresses on Education is to make the researchers aware of current trends in different fields, learn about the research conducted in different areas and help them discuss new trends and encourage interdisciplinary research. Therefore, the theme of the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 is “Interdisciplinary Research in Education”. Highlighting this theme does not mean underestimating or neglecting other important aspects of educational research and practice.The ERPA International Congresses on Education will publish an “ e-book of abstracts with ISBN ” and “ e-book of full texts with ISBN ”. Meanwhile, selected proceedings will be sent to the journal of SHS Web of Conferences for publication (if the authors request and pay the publication fee). ERPA 2015 and ERPA 2016 issues that are published in SHS Web of Conferences have already indexed in ISI Web of Knowledge . Meanwhile, ERPA 2014 issue that was published in the journal of Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences was also indexed in ISI Web of Knowledge . These proceedings should be well-written in terms of language use (the language of proceedings is English) and should be 5 to 8 pages in length. In addition, some selected proceedings can be referred for the publication in the journals that supporting the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018. In that case the authors should obey the publishers’ rules.Thanks for your consideration and we look forward to meeting all of you in Istanbul / Turkey.Best regards,Organizing Committee of ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018Important DatesEarly Bird Registration Deadline* : 31 March 2018Abstract Submission Deadline       : 25 May 2018Registration Deadline                      : 01 June 2018Full Paper Deadline                         : 20 July 2018Congress Dates                                 : 28 June - 01 July 2018*The registration fee should be paid till this date[3] [Bild: Facebook] [4] [Bild: Twitter] [5] [Bild: Linkedin] [6] [Bild: Google Plus][7] Mail almak istemiyorsan?z [8] Üyelikten Ayr?l [9] t?klay?n?z.?leti düzgün görünmüyorsa [10] Webde görüntüle [11] .Bu ileti size SendMail arac? hizmet sa?lay?c?s? kanal?yla iletilmi?tir.[12] Links____________________________________________________________________________1. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/Xn1kcO4aTTkr6W76K-qOeNkGm_WMDaTUT-Kgf7pH3Bk2. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/Y07Ou1R7OALjN_NNkjJJDZiIE2mHwd8lC7xta5TmMew3. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/9LeyBvGT4FT3h6VVm3B8f2PRwnHT94Z-7Gyb26syGU04. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/EZ6JdlmDMXjLYztpoCuJw50mwmyCLrAalFi9aPEEVMM5. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/W2xw4A0WV_Iss-Nv8abNFbwdhLPC8Fk94LUaBtUydqA6. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/ZJAxsq2TqiXVZpn3CUEqiyzVGvy_m2AkvnXQ31qreVw7. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/PIgy8_bWwrJ7zxjh6teLKR0NQzmudaylmp1yhIitu0Q8. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/KjqlgDgieHS0uZELqAxxv1dkF1P0AGbm5oNgyHg8Qh49. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/rM8lBKlshxPFrvzFWIknZkWI33IqTab8uzTuXOe5TOE10. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/gonXhQ0cN5B7NrTtR1qfDb-WLDgUPRVo955dXT3WNA411. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/A9D8uff-BUXCTY-fL9L45NbYse75FNZcWztXti_Vl-I12. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/nwyY8PZQ4laMEU80pea7WLnJrRjqKAIPIA_Acs9Q160"

162229	New Release from Atlantic Pubslishing	"Book Spotlight of the week:              Childhood Trauma and the Non-Alpha Male   Retail Price - $24.95 * Paperback ISBN: 9781620235980 * E-Book: 9781620235997The social perception of masculinity is very black and white — one is either an Alpha Male or a Beta Male, and there can be no variation. However, this is not the reality of masculinity in today’s society. Non-Alpha Males exist somewhere in the middle of the masculinity spectrum and are far more common than most people realize.These Non-Alpha Males are prone to developmental and behavioral issues caused by gender role conflict, toxic shame, and complex trauma. These, as well as the role of parenting, attachment and abuse issues, gender constructs and socialization, and the resulting addiction, sexual issues, and self-loathing, are explored in “Childhood Trauma and the Non-Alpha Male”.Dr. Carpenter’s book offers healthy resolutions through self-acceptance and psychological health. With stories of experiences from actual Non-Alpha Male clients bringing the theoretical into reality, “Childhood Trauma and the Non-Alpha Male” helps offer healing through hope, clarity, healing, and change.  Contact us here to order yours today! Atlantic Publishing Group, Inc. 1405 SW 6th Avenue Ocala, FL, 34471? Ph: 352-622-1825 Fx: 352-622-1875_                                                                                                                                     Unsubscribe                            Atlantic Publishing Group 1405 SW 6th Ave                                                                                                                                                                                                        _"

And, what is it like working your way back, seemingly against all odds? Actor, writer, director and professor Eric Barr developed an infection after open-heart surgery that triggered a series of devastating strokes, robbing him of speech, movement and all of his future plans. But it didn't rob him of hope.                                                                                           In this moving documentary, Eric Barr is back to tell the tale. Filmed during a live performance of Eric's one-man show, A Piece of My Mind takes viewers on his incredible journey from near-death to recovery and reinvention. It is a celebration of life, love and the human spirit.                                                                                                                                                                                    (25 min.

I power cycled the projector, switcher, and checked the connections from the computer > switcher > power injector > link box > projector and all seemed fine. The projector menu was displaying upside down, so I think It might have been reset.

161701	ERPA Congresses on Education 2019_third call	"ERPA Congresses on Education 2019_third callERPA International Congresses on Education 2018[1] www.erpacongress.comDear Colleague,It is with great pleasure to inform you about the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 that will be held in Istanbul / Turkey from 28 June to 1 July 2018 ( [2] www.erpacongress.com ). We hope that the conference will enable you to share your research with an international research community and to engage in discussion about the current issues in the field of education. We want you to remember ERPA International Congresses on Education as a place where you discussed the issues and questions that count for your research, renewed relations with your colleagues and made contacts that helped you to develop new directions in your work. Congress languages are English and Turkish.Ten branch congresses will be held concurrently in ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018; - ERPA International Educational Sciences Congress - ERPA International Science and Mathematics Education Congress - ERPA International Social Sciences Education Congress - ERPA International Health and Sports Science Education Congress - ERPA International Music and Fine Arts Education Congress - ERPA International Special Education Congress - ERPA International Computer Education and Instructional Technology Congress - ERPA International Language Education Congress - ERPA International Management of Education Congress - ERPA International Engineering and Architecture Education CongressWhile registering the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 you will be asked to choose the one that is related to your field of study. The main purpose in incorporating ten congresses within the scope of ERPA International Congresses on Education is to make the researchers aware of current trends in different fields, learn about the research conducted in different areas and help them discuss new trends and encourage interdisciplinary research. Therefore, the theme of the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 is “Interdisciplinary Research in Education”. Highlighting this theme does not mean underestimating or neglecting other important aspects of educational research and practice.The ERPA International Congresses on Education will publish an “ e-book of abstracts with ISBN ” and “ e-book of full texts with ISBN ”. Meanwhile, selected proceedings will be sent to the journal of SHS Web of Conferences for publication (if the authors request and pay the publication fee). ERPA 2015 and ERPA 2016 issues that are published in SHS Web of Conferences have already indexed in ISI Web of Knowledge . Meanwhile, ERPA 2014 issue that was published in the journal of Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences was also indexed in ISI Web of Knowledge . These proceedings should be well-written in terms of language use (the language of proceedings is English) and should be 5 to 8 pages in length. In addition, some selected proceedings can be referred for the publication in the journals that supporting the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018. In that case the authors should obey the publishers’ rules.Thanks for your consideration and we look forward to meeting all of you in Istanbul / Turkey.Best regards,Organizing Committee of ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018Important DatesEarly Bird Registration Deadline* : 31 March 2018Abstract Submission Deadline       : 25 May 2018Registration Deadline                      : 01 June 2018Full Paper Deadline                         : 20 July 2018Congress Dates                                 : 28 June - 01 July 2018*The registration fee should be paid till this date[3] [Bild: Facebook] [4] [Bild: Twitter] [5] [Bild: Linkedin] [6] [Bild: Google Plus][7] Mail almak istemiyorsan?z [8] Üyelikten Ayr?l [9] t?klay?n?z.?leti düzgün görünmüyorsa [10] Webde görüntüle [11] .Bu ileti size SendMail arac? hizmet sa?lay?c?s? kanal?yla iletilmi?tir.[12] Links____________________________________________________________________________1. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/XFqNyfWBsRV-h9aRiBBFbLcxJWunK7UvwHs36mAb4lk2. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/_fZGZxDZ58xpQSuLeGXKhpevvnbFvXXEsYWALNY7pbk3. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/ZyYGtb5haPPbNDwFYwz3jw21Mey3kfQxiImLr9aGYpE4. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/ejRTGlNVRTSa9j9DlCrm_fg1WVZ-vcaYKVW6XXfrQ2o5. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/zBTwsAXFavdL-6OJPCiYyQhPVx03Kt0Wv8ZtyTXTrSM6. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/N83k--PxqqKWpxmx_6WlOb-OjnDFS3TbooEavsRck847. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/GYjvXMZ7vBsqUj2XBUPStjrQre8m-fd2adi_3wxSF6Q8. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/Xh9jLZkRpTWK9gvDRSOp-wg_DOYQzpUWJwUQLhX0XWc9. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/u0SZFxtqTmq-dpTsGaYHL1HcJtMNW9PptydE9rt7nV010. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/e7kiXzaLLkLsuL-qCZuGjppET8FlXr0E32WJ18h1q4o11. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/J43ikm48nqQCkohwbD5XFPHehrfgB5imZi8CT40ZTRE12. http://erpacongress.sendmailx.net/i/fa3Gr_KBWdxfhYj9viVlgO5DKQfk0TrFoUyXkMZ9kGY"	"<note date=""4/17/19 1:00 pm"" author=""baldwin-tech"" type=""tech"" time=""0"" rate=""No Charge"">This ticket is spam.  </note>"

"<note date=""4/8/19 2:12 pm"" author=""karsten"" type=""client"">Request Detail from Ticket 161254:*Nygreen 5*: Hi,I teach a class in Nygreen 5 and it appears that someone has unplugged and replugged in several of the cables. In addition, the computer VGA cable is completely unplugged and damaged (it no longer connects to the monitor). I have no idea why someone would not care for the equipment in this room, but can't really solve that. Where I could use help is that teaching with the current setup is really, really difficult! Is it possible to put a rush on fixing the computer/monitor situation in Nygreen 5? I think all professors who use that room would probably benefit from it. Thanks if you can help!Kristopher B.

If you come across an AV related issue you are to call our media services front desk immediately.  our number is (805)493-3820 and we will take a look at it as it falls under our responsibility.  These switchers have several connections and only work in a specific manner that we have programmed.  On top of that, AV Designs vary from one room to another.  Attempting to fix a switcher without understanding the design of the classroom undermines IT workflow and can affect the equipment and service that we provide as a department.   Therefore, please leave the projection, audio, and switcher repairs to us.  </note><note date=""4/9/19 10:55 am"" author=""isstech-tech"" type=""tech"" time=""0"" rate=""No Charge"">OCSS</note><note date=""4/15/19 12:08 pm"" author=""hdstudent-tech"" type=""tech"" time=""0"" rate=""No Charge"">This morning when class began at 10:30 AM in Nygreen 5, client was unable to get projector to work. Apparently, projector had recently been fixed (see request from ticket 161245) Issue may be occurring because someone who uses the classroom at other times is unplugging the projector. Then, when client needs to teach Evolution, is unable to get projector to display anything or connect correctly.This has impacted the class time as the class has had to switch classrooms for the past two class sections due to the same issue.Issue needs to be looked into soon, within the next day or so because it is effecting the class. I will go ahead and call media services to notify them about the ticket.In the meantime I will call client to follow up, then assign this to media services.call client at x3385Lindsay</note><note date=""4/9/19 11:39 am"" author=""isstech-tech"" type=""tech"" time=""0"" rate=""No Charge"">Hello Dr. KarstenSomeone broke the cable that connected the the presenter's display to the computer and in attempt to still use the main presenters display, they plugged the cable meant for displaying a presenter's laptop into the presenter's display. Normally this would be a Media Services issue, but this was a pretty easy fix so we were able to solve the problem by installing a new cable from the computer to the presenter's display.If you have any other issues, feel free to let us know by calling or emailing Helpdesk.StuTechext. 3095Skyler</note><note date=""4/15/19 11:50 am"" author=""karsten"" type=""client"">Hi,Just a quick follow up on this: the fix lasted one whole day before someone undid everything. Currently the situation is that I can see the monitor, but there’s no way to get it to project to the screen. I’ve tried about everything I can. Why someone is doing this, I have no idea. I will acquire a list of faculty who use that room and see if we can get it to stop, but in the meantime I can’t hold class in there because someone keeps messing with all the cables. I don’t know if this is more of a media services issue than help desk, but thought I’d start here first.Thanks if you can get this resolved soon!Kristopher B.
