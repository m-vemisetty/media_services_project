163882	Media Services	Graduation Playback	Hey Media Services!

Thank for your wonderful work recording all the graduation festivities!
I'm not sure whether you're aware, but the recording isn't working on the
"On Demand" site. It was working a couple days ago under the
"pre-commencement" video which showed the whole ceremony, but the one up
now won't let us view!

Thanks a million and my apologies if you're already on fixing it (or if its
not your job, I'd super appreciate if you'd just forward this message on!)
Gratefully,
Petra

Hi Rob and Carlos,

I hope this email finds you both well.  I need help, like in years past, with my track and field banquet.  It is on a Saturday and NOT a Sunday this year so I hope that helps.  It is on Sunday, May 4th at 11:00am in the Arena.  We run a video/slide show and I will need a worker to run that for me from up in the booth.  Last year Carlos did it for me and that was amazing and ran SO smooth if we could do that again!  The banquet starts at 11:00am but people start coming about 10:30am.  We usually show the video about 11:30am and it runs for about 20 minutes.  Once the video is complete the worker is done because we will have nothing else that we need in terms of videos.  However, I will also need a mic down below to speak on.

169400	Media Services : Installs	Swenson 101- No projector	Hello All,
The Executive MBA Program held a scheduled weekend class session for EMBA 500 this last weekend (Saturday 9/24 and Sunday 9/25 9am -6pm) in Swenson 101 and the projector was not working. Once I finally got the helpdesk on the phone after 10 am, the helpdesk employee confirmed with media services that "the projector was not working and a new one was ordered" he said that "media services worked with events to makes sure there wasn't any event scheduled in the room." The professor, Dr. Sengupta unfortunately had to move to a smaller uninhabited room, which was undesirable as it affected multiple Sodexo food setups, Air conditioning, and comfortable space for the nearly 30 people.

What's done is done, but I am trying to track down a clear explanation for the oversite in the attempt to obtain assurance that this won't happen again. I know it was a class and not booked through events directly but the reservation was in ASTRA, so not sure why we were not notified about a projector not working when there was a class scheduled. Obviously the campus is cognizant of the UG terms and start dates, but note between the 8-week term and the 11-week terms there are many weekends we host students, which will fall during the UG summer, on UG holidays and UG spring break.
We have over 50 Executive MBA students who are on campus one weekend a month and at over $1100 a credit, they deserve to have fully functioning classrooms and not be shuffled between rooms all weekend. Unfortunately this has not been the first weekend issue, we have had issues with doors being locked before 6pm, double bookings, etc.
Hopefully we can all work together to prevent any future issues.

Please note the Sodexo staff who set up the meals were very accommodating and Jon Urango helped with the AC in the alternate rooms all weekend as well. However, I would like to avoid having to ask other departments and staff for additional support based on an oversight.
Best,

163915	Media Services : Installs	HDMI wiring in student union	There is a ceiling-mounted projector in the Student Union used as a large display for a video game console. Since the projector is ceiling mounted, there are wall-mounted access plugs for AV connection cables that feed all the way to the ceiling-mounted projector. Previously, the console used for this projector was a standard definition Nintendo Wii; however, we have upgraded this device to a high definition Nintendo Switch. Unfortunately, there are no HDMI access ports on the wall-mounted access panel. We will need an HDMI connection installed in the wall-mount access panel for connection to this ceiling-mounted projector.

Dear Ruby,



I will be using the power point slides and lecture notes that are available on CENGAGE for the upcoming course. I was wondering what devices are available in class to accommodate the downloading and presenting the slides to the class. I'm assuming there is a computer and overhead projector. Will I be able to access the internet to download the course material online?



Please advise.

Hi Media Services;

We now have a confirmed location which is the Student Union lower level lobby and outside patio. We will need to setup the presentation inside but in a location so as many people as possible can see. We would also request that speakers are put outside as we expect we will overflow outside this space as well. You’re the experts but maybe 4 speakers inside (or two large) and two outside?

On another note - Just a radical idea? Is there a way just to use the large monitor in that space. Perhaps that would work? I’d have to go over there and check it out, but that is a pretty large monitor that runs the latest announcements. Can  slide show be clicked from that monitor some how? I’d have to see if you can see from many angles as well.

Anyway, now you know the space for now. We can touch base on the details any time.

Thanks

Hello Susan,
Thank you for letting us know about this event ahead of time, However we can’t put this event into our system until a location is confirmed (, so we can use the appropriate resources for the given location). Once you have confirmed your event’s location email us and we’ll put it in asap. Also, I’m afraid that we are unable to give you 6 speaker, would 2 suffice.
Thank you,

Dear Ruby,



I will be using the power point slides and lecture notes that are available on CENGAGE for the upcoming course. I was wondering what devices are available in class to accommodate the downloading and presenting the slides to the class. I'm assuming there is a computer and overhead projector. Will I be able to access the internet to download the course material online?



Please advise.



Best,

181104	Media Services : Media Requests	Biggest Little Farm details for next month	Hello all:

The screening of The Biggest Little Farm is coming up in less than a month – Friday, March 20, 7 pm.  John Chester, the farmer and filmmaker, is planning on staying for a 45 minute Q & A after the film. His contract specified from 8:30-9:15pm – so I don’t think we could get him on a tour of the garden prior to the start of the screening, so I am focusing on what we can do:

A few details as we get closer to our date:

  1.  Sam – are you willing to introduce the film and facilitate the Q& A after the screening? I thought this would be an appropriate time to talk about the SEED program and maybe even do an “ask” for donations if you feel this is appropriate.
  2.  Lala – I know the Chester’s also have a children’s book out about one of the stars of the show, Saving Emma the Pig<https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Emma-Biggest-Little-Farm/dp/1250187796>, I am not sure if you want to request a copy of it for display, etc., but if you do, my contact at Apricot Lane Farms is:

apricotlanefarms.com<https://apricotlanefarms.com?utm_source=email_signature&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=general_signature>




  1.  Kristin – Are you able to have the SEED garden students there with a “farmers market” and the bee group, too? In our last meeting I have noted that  you were willing to do this. We have gotten a lot of interest from the community – so I would love to have this type of student showcase going on as members of the community arrive. Do you need me to request permission to  have those groups  around the “Gumby” area or will you and the students handle that?
  2.  Cynthia – I think I shared this link with you before for the promo materials: https://neon.app.box.com/s/pikdt2zav35j2fs5tgculusnapty9a42  - but if there is anything else you need, let me know.
  3.  Media Services: I have submitted the request for a BlueRay player and two mics for the Q & A following. Who will be staffing the event that night in case we have technical difficulties?
  4.  All – I have rec’d many inquiries re: the show from the community. They all wanted to know where to reserve tickets. When I explain to them that there are not tickets – it is first-come, first seated – most are OK, but I have a woman who is bringing elderly folks who wants to know how early she can get there to reserve 8-10 places for her group (The Italian American Club) – as they want to attend as a club event. Thoughts on this?? Cynthia – you might have the most experience with this type of request. I’d appreciate some guidance.
  5.  Prior to the start of the semester, I  sent an email to 21 faculty who teach topics related to sustainability or film – informing them about the event and encouraging them to add it to their syllabi – some have done so, but please encourage your colleagues to have students attend.

I am sure there are other items I am missing – as I am not typically an events planner on campus – so please speak up if I am missing a task/opportunity connected with this event.

Many thanks for you collaboration!

Hi Bruce,

If you have everything good to go on your end (Zoom session scheduled on an account) and are good with using the computer audio with zoom rather than a dedicated conference phone, then yup all you need is a webcam which can be requested through media services.

80+% of the zoom session requests need more than just a webcam and some handholding to start the session at the computer hence why media services sent you to me.   If you are comfortable getting the session started on your own, which is what it sounds like that is the case, then you should be good to go and all that’s needed would be a webcam on a small tripod for you.

Let me know if you need any help!

169576	Media Services : Media Requests	Lutheran Highed Ed - Tues, Sept. 3	Hi,
Campus Ministry/Mission and Identity staff will be presenting a NSO session called "Lutheran Higher Education"  in Soiland Gym at 10:30am on Tuesday, Sept. 3. I know that Student Life has put in a request so that we have Media Services help and are prepared to show a Powerpoint.

Members of our team are still adding and editing their slides and I am leaving town next week!  It will be impossible for me to have a final version of the PP for you on a drive.  So, below you will find a link to the Powerpoint we will use at that session.  I will task Pastor Scott with providing you with a script that contains slide change notes.

I need to take that requires the latest form of adobe flash and has access

possible to rent out one of the computers in the computer room to take the
exam however I can not have anyone enter it because it involves speech for
a Grad School.

179829	Media Services : Media Requests	Projecting my iphone on computer screen	Dear Chris,


The reason for my email is regarding a class called Musical Acoustic (PHYS-120).  I teach the class in Building D room 9.


One of the computers is connected to a projector.  I use that computer to present charts or others during class.


I was hoping to also present in class some application displays from my iphone. I was wondering if there is a simple way to mirror my phone screen to the computer so I can show my screen through the class projector?


Please let me know if there is a way or if you have something else to suggest!

Thank You!

Hello all: In January I had sent out the email below inviting you and your students to the screening of the film The Biggest Little Farm on Friday, March 20 at 7 pm in the Preus-Brandt Forum. Given the social distancing procedures put in place, I am cancelling this event. Once campus operations normalize, I will work with John Chester to bring him and his film to campus.

Many thanks for your support.
Stay well!

My working day may not be your working day. Please do not feel obliged to reply to this email outside of your normal working hours.



Subject: An event you may want to add to your syllabus


Hello and Happy New Year! You are receiving this email because I wanted to make you aware of a special event happening in the Spring that might relate to one of the courses you or someone in your department is teaching. We will be screening the film The Biggest Little Farm on Friday, March 20 at 7 pm in the Preus-Brandt Forum. Admission is free. Following the film will be a Q&A with the farmer/writer/director.


If you teach a course that includes the topic of environmental sustainability, sustainable food initiatives or film, I encourage you to consider adding this course to your Spring syllabus and requiring or requesting that your students attend.


Here is a link to the film’s trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfDTM4JxHl8, and I’ve also attached the press notes. Something of additional interest – the farm featured in this film<https://www.apricotlanefarms.com/> is just minutes from the Thousand Oaks campus – in Moorpark, CA (and yes, they do offer tours). The film is beautiful, and has been accepted to many film festivals.


Please feel free to share this email with others who may have an interest, including adjuncts in your department. The event is supported by The College of Arts and Sciences, The Sarah W. Heath Center for Equality and Justice and Cal Lutheran’s Pearson Library.


Please let me know if you have additional questions.


Many thanks for supporting this opportunity.

I am cc’ing Peggy so she can put “canceled” by the online Calendar listing.
We are working on messaging for several larger events – like Hats & High Tea – that are being canceled or postponed.

Hi pat,



Hope you had a nice Christmas and New Year.  I am sorry to bother you but the projection screen in HUM 111 has been marked with a black marker in the middle and is very distracting.  Could you have someone check it out and see if it can be repaired or replaced.  I use lots of visuals, as you know, and it's location is in the wrong spot to just ignore.

?

Also, I wanted to include my syllabi which are attached.



Thanks

Media Services:

·         1 large speaker will be place next to the closes outside door with a wire leading to a second large speaker outside. The wire will go up the door jam and outside. Media will cover the wire with electrical or some kind of tape for safety.

172415	Media Services : Media Requests	FW: William Rolland Art Center, Room 212	I’m in WRAC212 teaching a class and for some reason when I play a Blu-ray disc in the Blu-ray player everything is fine. But if I play a DVD in the Blu-ray player and the film is a 4:3 format, then the player stretches the film to a 16:9 format. Is there a way to fix that?

Thanks,

Subject: Swenson 101- No projector

Hello All,
The Executive MBA Program held a scheduled weekend class session for EMBA 500 this last weekend (Saturday 9/24 and Sunday 9/25 9am -6pm) in Swenson 101 and the projector was not working. Once I finally got the helpdesk on the phone after 10 am, the helpdesk employee confirmed with media services that "the projector was not working and a new one was ordered" he said that "media services worked with events to makes sure there wasn't any event scheduled in the room." The professor, Dr. Sengupta unfortunately had to move to a smaller uninhabited room, which was undesirable as it affected multiple Sodexo food setups, Air conditioning, and comfortable space for the nearly 30 people.

What's done is done, but I am trying to track down a clear explanation for the oversite in the attempt to obtain assurance that this won't happen again. I know it was a class and not booked through events directly but the reservation was in ASTRA, so not sure why we were not notified about a projector not working when there was a class scheduled. Obviously the campus is cognizant of the UG terms and start dates, but note between the 8-week term and the 11-week terms there are many weekends we host students, which will fall during the UG summer, on UG holidays and UG spring break.
We have over 50 Executive MBA students who are on campus one weekend a month and at over $1100 a credit, they deserve to have fully functioning classrooms and not be shuffled between rooms all weekend. Unfortunately this has not been the first weekend issue, we have had issues with doors being locked before 6pm, double bookings, etc.
Hopefully we can all work together to prevent any future issues.

Please note the Sodexo staff who set up the meals were very accommodating and Jon Urango helped with the AC in the alternate rooms all weekend as well. However, I would like to avoid having to ask other departments and staff for additional support based on an oversight.
Best,

165806	Media Services : Media Requests	August Faculty Retreat	Dear Media Services,

The August Faculty Retreat will be held on Wed., Aug. 28 (beginning at noon) - Thurs., Aug. 29 (ending at 4pm), at the River Ridge Residence Inn by Marriott, 2101 West Vineyard Ave., Oxnard.

We hope you will be able to assist with the A/V for the Retreat again this year.  The hotel will provide an LCD projector with screen and one standard wired microphone in the general session room.  We will provide any additional A/V equipment required. Once the agenda and breakouts are finalized, we will have a better idea of the equipment needed. I've copied Michael Gagliardo, FEC Chair, who can provide you with that information.

Please note the time change from last year.  As such, you will probably only need to stay at the hotel on Wednesday night this year.

We will provide additional details soon - just wanted to make sure that this is on your calendar, and that you will be available to assist.

Thank you!
Judy Beaulieu
Academic Affairs Executive Assistant

176334	Media Services : Media Requests	Screen in Swenson 105	Hello,

Thanks to your staff for coming to re-boot the projector in Swenson 105 today, much appreciated.  I forgot to ask what the problem was (presumably easy) so I can fix it myself next time.

But mostly I'm writing to let you know that the screen in that room is catching on some overhead obstruction when being lowered; we had to get a student on a table reaching way up there to release it both Friday and today, in order for the screen to come down.  I don't know if does this every time, but you might want to send someone to check it out.

Thanks,

161471	Media Services : Media Requests	Track & Field Banquet - Media Services	Hi Rob and Carlos,

I hope this email finds you both well.  I need help, like in years past, with my track and field banquet.  It is on a Saturday and NOT a Sunday this year so I hope that helps.  It is on Sunday, May 4th at 11:00am in the Arena.  We run a video/slide show and I will need a worker to run that for me from up in the booth.  Last year Carlos did it for me and that was amazing and ran SO smooth if we could do that again!  The banquet starts at 11:00am but people start coming about 10:30am.  We usually show the video about 11:30am and it runs for about 20 minutes.  Once the video is complete the worker is done because we will have nothing else that we need in terms of videos.  However, I will also need a mic down below to speak on.

Can you please set this up for me?  I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

If you have any questions for me please let me know.

Thank you and look forward to hearing from you!

174945	Media Services : Media Requests	FW: Audio not working in HUM 106	Hi,

As of this morning, at least, the audio in HUM 106 isn’t working.  On Wednesday, I tried to show a powerpoint hyperlink to a website—but I was unable to figure out how to get sound.
On Friday, the same thing happened with a DVD that I wanted to show a portion of.

Sorry not to call this to your attention sooner—it has been a busy day!

Thanks.

174338	Media Services : Media Requests	Sound in Westlake room 113	Hello,

There is an issue with the audio in room 113 in the Westlake location. This is the continuation of an issue that was reported as resolved (Ticket 173447). The amplifier was replaced. Right now sound can come through the speakers of the computer, but no sound comes through the projector and so the sound is too quiet. Also, the projector speakers do not appear to be an option to select when selecting audio output.

168355	Media Services : Media Requests	48 Hour Film Jam Possible Equipment	Hello,

We are currently planning ahead for the CLU 48HR Film Jam Fall 2019 And we
were wondering about film equipment you guys might have. In the past we've
rented gear packages that included: cameras Canon C100, media cards,
lenses, sound equipment like boom mics, cables, headsets, and tripods.

We were wondering if you guys have enough gear similar or equivalent that
we might be able to put on hold for the end of September. Right now we're
possibly having 5-7 groups of teams participating, so possibly 5-7 sets of
equipment. Not every team is going to use every set, but we want to have a
couple of sets ready for teams to use if they want to.


Thank you for your help and hope to hear back soon.


Sincerely,

172413	Media Services : Repairs	Swenson 110 HDMI Issue	We recently upgraded the instructor station in Swenson 110 and the new computer uses USB-C. The USB-C adapter we ordered seems to have display issues when the computer is plugged in, but does not have issues if we plug the computer in using the HDMI labeled "AUX" instead of the one meant for the instructor station.

Please let me know a good time to meet with someone familiar with the switcher and we can tackle the issue.

Hi Pat,

I’ve been having some problems with the projector in Humanities 106, during my Psyc 313 class. Each class (last Thursday and this Tuesday), it has just shut off during lecture. Thankfully it will turn back on, but it is disruptive to the students. We noticed today that it shut down exactly at 3pm. Maybe it is on a timer?

Could you please forward this email to the department who can help me fix this issue? I really appreciate your help!

Ari

179749	Media Services : Repairs	ALS Classroom in Library	We received a phone call about the ALS Class room located in the Library not having working sound. When we got there we noticed that the hdmi cable that was supposed to be used for laptops had been plugged into the computer. After looking into the issue further we came to the conclusion that the website the video was trying to be played off of had a bad media player and was causing the audio issues. We solved this issue by having having a laptop be plugged in and playing the video through an hdmi and AUX cord. We tested to make sure the sound could be played through youtube and other sources and it worked fine.
172093	Media Services : Repairs	URGENT: need HDMI fixed in 107C in Westlake	Good Morning,

Can we have someone please look at it today and get it fixed?

THANKS SO MUCH!

179750	Media Services : Repairs	Help Desk- Swenson 124	Last week, (the week of 1/27/20) a teacher called the office, listing several issues in Swenson 124. The professor said that the projector had a color tint to it, the laptop connection wasn't working, among other issues.
Student workers Mia G. and Harrison R. went to the classroom today (2/3/20)  around 5PM, and the projector/ computer were working fine. This issue has been resolved.

(Not sure if this was already taken care of last week, but we decided to go and check it out regardless)

181059	Media Services : Repairs	Humanities 113	The projector was displaying the monitor screen, but the monitor itself was not turning on.

Student techs Brandon Perera and Harrison Ruud went to the conference room and tried to see about the connection. The patron had her laptop (Mac) USB-C connected to a VGA adapter from the office. The television screen did not recognize the connection and said that there was no signal. This issue was not resolved.
181140	Media Services : Repairs	ALUM 113	Patron called about projector in Alum 113 being blurry and hard to see. I went over there and checked that the resolution was correct.

182136	Media Services : Repairs	Help Desk	Patron called about a problem with the sound coming from the Blu-ray player in Swenson 101. They said that there was no sound coming from the room when they played the movie. The disk was the problem and there was no issue with the system.

182278	Media Services : Repairs	Projector may not be working for class tonight	Client said that per powerpoint wasn't projecting last class and was hoping that someone could meet her around 6:45pm in Humanities room 124 to make sure that it will be working today for her 7pm class. If you could get back to her ASAP she needs to know if she'll have to cancel her class for tonight. She wants you to call her at 805-294-2983 just to tell her if you're going to be coming or not so she can cancel if she needs to.

170429	Media Services : Repairs	RE: D-9 Projector	We have 10 lab sections, 2 communications classes, 1 upper division physics course and Ryan's Professionals class in D-9 this semester. Six instructors are using the room. The AV system is not up to par for this intensive use.

To use a laptop, you need to physically disconnect AV cables. These are not always reconnected which is typically not a problem for those of us familiar with how the stuff works. It is a real mess, though, for less frequent users of the room.

Given the usage and difficulties being experienced we need to quickly invest in an interface comparable to the "smart" classrooms so that people can use laptops, audio, etc. without creating difficulties for the next instructor in D-9.

Hello Help Desk,

Please know that the instructor PC in D-9 is not connected to the projector, AND the projector makes a very loud buzzing sound.

I teach in Swenson 111 and it seems that when the picture is displayed on the projector from the computer that it is truncated.  So the picture that is projects takes up only about half of the projector screen.  Everything on the actual desktop seems small too (icons, etc).  Can someone please take a look at this?


Thank you,

170185	Media Services : Repairs	Problem with Computer Display in Alumni Hall 112	Hello,
I am teaching English 335 in Alumni 112 on T/Th from 9:35-10:50.  This morning (the first day of the class), I could not get either the Cal Lutheran website or (especially) Blackboard to display properly from the classroom monitor, let alone the projection screen. On the classroom (desk) monitor at the front corner of the room, the website is never fully displayed at once.  After an attempt at adjusting it, I could get most of it up, but in tiny print. In Blackboard for my course (English 335) I could not see or find any of the purple navigational menu buttons, which are usually displayed on the left-hand side of the screen.  None of the content I had loaded to the class seemed to be there, although when I returned to my office, I could easily find it there on my office monitor, and of course, I could also find the purple navigational buttons on the left side of the screen.

It may be that I don't know how to adjust the smart touch monitor so that it displays everything; however, I have never had this problem with a classroom monitor before.  Please advise me what to do, and let me know if the problem can be fixed.  I tried three different internet browsers:  Chrome, Mozilla, and Internet Explorer.  Not one of them showed me the content that I had placed on my course Blackboard page yesterday and this morning, and so I could not put any of that content on the projection screen to show the students in my class.

Thank you!
Jim

170165	Media Services : Repairs	LCD Projector: Scale of Image Too Small in Nygreen 5	Dear Media Services:
I just spoke with Roemello, and he recommended that I write an email to Media Services regarding the size of the image being projected onto the screen in Nygreen 5.  I teach in the classroom on MWF, and am hoping to expand the scale of the image, as the last two rows are struggling to read/see what is on my PowerPoint slides.  If it could be expanded to fit the entire nylon screen available, that would be amazing.  Thank you so much for your help, in advance, It is really appreciated!

?Hi,



I'm a new adjunct here so I hope I'm emailing the correct people! I have a class in WRAC 114 on MWF from 9:15-10:05am and there is a computer but the monitor (a Dell) had a blue screen and I could not do anything on the computer. I'm not completely technophobic, but nothing worked. I do need to use the computer as we have lots of powerpoints in class. Can someone please check it out? And if it is a totally easy fix and I missed something, I apologize in advance.



Thank you,

He also said he tried the dial on the sound system. He says that even when he tried other video websites like Youtube the audio does work. Before he called us he decided on his own to unwire the sound system and now some one need to set that back up. He says this is the second time the sound system has not worked in this classroom. 

We need someone to reconfigure the sound system and test the computer to make sure the audio works. He says he can push back the lecture that requires this video. But ASAP would be good as he said his entire lecture is center around this video.

Subject: Helpdesk Ticket for Nygreen 4

On July 23rd at 11:00AM, Diana Lopez from Upward Bound called about Nygreen 4 needing a new lamp in the projector. She said the projector said it needs a new lamp according to the message that was being projected on the screen. It still works and they are out of the classroom at 11:50AM today. It could be needing a lamp hour reset.

162148	Media Services : Repairs	Humanities 107 projector	We got a call from HUM 107 about a projector issue and it was outputting a grey color that wouldn’t change when inputs were changed. I power cycled the projector, switcher, and checked the connections from the computer > switcher > power injector > link box > projector and all seemed fine. The projector menu was displaying upside down, so I think It might have been reset. The projector did recognize an HDMI plugged in, so I think the problem is in between the switcher and projector.

Please look at it when you can.

Hope your summer session is going well. All is well with the rooms for the South Coast Writing Project.

Our tv situation is looking pretty bleak over here and need the IT guys to know what's up.

We have 6 tvs older than 5 years old - current operating condition:

42" over Promo table - not working at all.
42" in 105A  - not working at all (we need to probably just take this down asap)
42" in lobby - only one working!
60" in Boardroom (large conference room) - cannot get a picture on it
60" in Main pavilion - picture but has a bad burn out in screen on the lower right side
60" in Outside lobby - incredibly bad picture and burn out - looks like crumpled paper on edges

If anything can be done, please let us (myself or Mike Panesis) know!

Thanks,
Victoria

165185	Media Services : Repairs	Helpdesk Ticket	We received a call today, around 9:05am about the projector in Swenson 102 not working. Upon further examination, the tech realized that the "combine" rooms button had not been selected. When the projector was up and running, the picture was crooked and aimed off screen, probably due to impact from the wall divider. One tech attempted to reposition the projector, but had to retrieve a projector remote to properly keystone the projector screen.

Our faculty who taught last night at Westlake room 105A reported that he couldn’t get the sound to go through the system and he tried all kinds of things but still didn’t work. He has class tomorrow night at 7pm in this classroom again and hopefully this won’t happen so the instruction can go smoothly.

Could you please have someone look into it soon and get it fixed by tomorrow afternoon? We’d really appreciate it!

Thanks much!

Subject: My class - 107b speakers in classroom

Hi Erica,
Is there anyway someone could check at the Westlake Village office room 107b speakers?  I am unable to play any videos in here because the speakers do not seem to be hooked up to the broader classroom.  I had brought this to Hub101 staff attention but it still seems to not be fixed.  Anyway to get this resolved before my next class on Tues?  Thanks.  Best Disha

Our HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator will give the ability to price small jobs (under $4000) with the speed and accuracy HomeTech Publishing products have been delivering for over 50 years. This comprehensive system is laid out the same as the HomeTech Publishing Remodeling & Renovation Cost Estimator with the same 25 divisions from Plans and Permits to final Clean-up.

A major feature of the HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator is that most of the items show the cost for a minimum sized job as well as costs for the same work in a large quantity. As all hands-on contractors know, there is preparation work required on every job — and sometimes on a smaller job there will be more time spent on preparation than actually performing the work!
Every contractor has customers who want them to perform small jobs for them — replacing sidewalks, repairing steps, installing locksets, fixing leaky plumbing — but until now there was not a good way to price this work AND MAKE MONEY!
When you complete a medium to large scale remodeling project and satisfy the homeowner, you create a customer for life. But when will they remodel again?
Many successful remodelers have discovered there is profit to be made in handyman work. Some even have separate divisions that only do handyman work — with most of the work performed for previously satisfied remodeling customers!
The HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator contains page after page of items that will give you accurate costs for virtually any small job your customer wants!
Every item contains a full description and is broken down to exact labor cost, material cost, total cost ,sales price to the customer, and hours required for each line item!

Let HomeTech Publishing Help You Get Those Estimates Off Your Desk And In Your Customers Hands!

Our HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator will give the ability to price small jobs (under $4000) with the speed and accuracy HomeTech Publishing products have been delivering for over 50 years. This comprehensive system is laid out the same as the HomeTech Publishing Remodeling & Renovation Cost Estimator with the same 25 divisions from Plans and Permits to final Clean-up.

A major feature of the HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator is that most of the items show the cost for a minimum sized job as well as costs for the same work in a large quantity. As all hands-on contractors know, there is preparation work required on every job — and sometimes on a smaller job there will be more time spent on preparation than actually performing the work!
Every contractor has customers who want them to perform small jobs for them — replacing sidewalks, repairing steps, installing locksets, fixing leaky plumbing — but until now there was not a good way to price this work AND MAKE MONEY!
When you complete a medium to large scale remodeling project and satisfy the homeowner, you create a customer for life. But when will they remodel again?
Many successful remodelers have discovered there is profit to be made in handyman work. Some even have separate divisions that only do handyman work — with most of the work performed for previously satisfied remodeling customers!
The HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator contains page after page of items that will give you accurate costs for virtually any small job your customer wants!
Every item contains a full description and is broken down to exact labor cost, material cost, total cost ,sales price to the customer, and hours required for each line item!

You can estimate any custom home in less time than ever before — with the completely updated HomeTech  Housebuilders Cost Estimator!
Take a minute now and ask yourself these 3 questions:
Are you spending too much time figuring estimates?
Are you sure that subcontractor estimates are accurate?
Are inaccurate estimates robbing you of profits?
If you answered YES to any of these questions, then it's time to put the HomeTech Publishing Housebuilders Cost Estimator to work for you!

Here are just a few of the many features that make the HomeTech Publishing Housebuilders Estimator the most popular on the market today:
UP-TO-DATE UNIT COSTS — Every item in the book has been researched to bring you the most up-to-date costs — thousands of items specifically researched for custom home building. Every cost printed in the book you order is specific to your local area — no other estimating system can deliver that kind of accuracy!
LATEST MATERIAL & INNOVATIONS — Throughout the year we research new products and building techniques, making sure that the items you need for your estimate are always available.
EXCLUSIVE HOMETECH PUBLISHING CATEGORIES — Our 25 categories are organized in the same order you would build the project. HomeTech Publishing doesn't lump a big portion of what you do under a non-specific category such as "wood & plastics". Our categories are more specific, and include sections like site work, framing, concrete, excavation, plumbing, and electrical.
The HomeTech Publishing Housebuilders Cost Estimator is more than a reference book — it's an entire estimating system. It's a system that lets you estimate complete houses in minutes, quickly double-check subcontractor bids, and get fast, easy access to labor and material costs, as well as man-hours for  every house you'll ever build!
TOLL-FREE TELEPHONE SUPPORT — Every year our customers call us with countless questions — and we answer each and every one of them! With the purchase of the HomeTech Housebuilders Cost Estimator, we welcome your calls on our toll-free help line.
Most importantly, the edition you receive has been researched specifically for the area you work in. And as you well know when you're estimating a custom home, accuracy is everything!

Our HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator will give the ability to price small jobs (under $4000) with the speed and accuracy HomeTech Publishing products have been delivering for over 50 years. This comprehensive system is laid out the same as the HomeTech Publishing Remodeling & Renovation Cost Estimator with the same 25 divisions from Plans and Permits to final Clean-up.

A major feature of the HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator is that most of the items show the cost for a minimum sized job as well as costs for the same work in a large quantity. As all hands-on contractors know, there is preparation work required on every job — and sometimes on a smaller job there will be more time spent on preparation than actually performing the work!
Every contractor has customers who want them to perform small jobs for them — replacing sidewalks, repairing steps, installing locksets, fixing leaky plumbing — but until now there was not a good way to price this work AND MAKE MONEY!
When you complete a medium to large scale remodeling project and satisfy the homeowner, you create a customer for life. But when will they remodel again?
Many successful remodelers have discovered there is profit to be made in handyman work. Some even have separate divisions that only do handyman work — with most of the work performed for previously satisfied remodeling customers!
The HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator contains page after page of items that will give you accurate costs for virtually any small job your customer wants!
Every item contains a full description and is broken down to exact labor cost, material cost, total cost and sales price to the customer.

You can estimate any custom home in less time than ever before — with the completely updated HomeTech  Housebuilders Cost Estimator!
Take a minute now and ask yourself these 3 questions:
Are you spending too much time figuring estimates?
Are you sure that subcontractor estimates are accurate?
Are inaccurate estimates robbing you of profits?
If you answered YES to any of these questions, then it's time to put the HomeTech Publishing Housebuilders Cost Estimator to work for you!

Here are just a few of the many features that make the HomeTech Publishing Housebuilders Estimator the most popular on the market today:
UP-TO-DATE UNIT COSTS — Every item in the book has been researched to bring you the most up-to-date costs — thousands of items specifically researched for custom home building. Every cost printed in the book you order is specific to your local area — no other estimating system can deliver that kind of accuracy!
LATEST MATERIAL & INNOVATIONS — Throughout the year we research new products and building techniques, making sure that the items you need for your estimate are always available.
EXCLUSIVE HOMETECH PUBLISHING CATEGORIES — Our 25 categories are organized in the same order you would build the project. HomeTech Publishing doesn't lump a big portion of what you do under a non-specific category such as "wood & plastics". Our categories are more specific, and include sections like site work, framing, concrete, excavation, plumbing, and electrical.
The HomeTech Publishing Housebuilders Cost Estimator is more than a reference book — it's an entire estimating system. It's a system that lets you estimate complete houses in minutes, quickly double-check subcontractor bids, and get fast, easy access to labor and material costs, as well as man-hours for  every house you'll ever build!
TOLL-FREE TELEPHONE SUPPORT — Every year our customers call us with countless questions — and we answer each and every one of them! With the purchase of the HomeTech Housebuilders Cost Estimator, we welcome your calls on our toll-free help line.
Most importantly, the edition you receive has been researched specifically for the area you work in. And as you well know when you're estimating a custom home, accuracy is everything!

Let HomeTech Publishing Help You Get Those Estimates Off Your Desk And In Your Customers Hands!

Our HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator will give the ability to price small jobs (under $4000) with the speed and accuracy HomeTech Publishing products have been delivering for over 50 years. This comprehensive system is laid out the same as the HomeTech Publishing Remodeling & Renovation Cost Estimator with the same 25 divisions from Plans and Permits to final Clean-up.

A major feature of the HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator is that most of the items show the cost for a minimum sized job as well as costs for the same work in a large quantity. As all hands-on contractors know, there is preparation work required on every job — and sometimes on a smaller job there will be more time spent on preparation than actually performing the work!
Every contractor has customers who want them to perform small jobs for them — replacing sidewalks, repairing steps, installing locksets, fixing leaky plumbing — but until now there was not a good way to price this work AND MAKE MONEY!
When you complete a medium to large scale remodeling project and satisfy the homeowner, you create a customer for life. But when will they remodel again?
Many successful remodelers have discovered there is profit to be made in handyman work. Some even have separate divisions that only do handyman work — with most of the work performed for previously satisfied remodeling customers!
The HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator contains page after page of items that will give you accurate costs for virtually any small job your customer wants!
Every item contains a full description and is broken down to exact labor cost, material cost, total cost and sales price to the customer.

ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018
[1] www.erpacongress.com
Dear Colleague,
It is with great pleasure to inform you about the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 that will be held in Istanbul / Turkey from 28 June to 1 July 2018 ( [2] www.erpacongress.com ). We hope that the conference will enable you to share your research with an international research community and to engage in discussion about the current issues in the field of education. We want you to remember ERPA International Congresses on Education as a place where you discussed the issues and questions that count for your research, renewed relations with your colleagues and made contacts that helped you to develop new directions in your work. Congress languages are English and Turkish.
Ten branch congresses will be held concurrently in ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018;
 - ERPA International Educational Sciences Congress
 - ERPA International Science and Mathematics Education Congress
 - ERPA International Social Sciences Education Congress
 - ERPA International Health and Sports Science Education Congress
 - ERPA International Music and Fine Arts Education Congress
 - ERPA International Special Education Congress

 - ERPA International Management of Education Congress
 - ERPA International Engineering and Architecture Education Congress
While registering the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 you will be asked to choose the one that is related to your field of study. The main purpose in incorporating ten congresses within the scope of ERPA International Congresses on Education is to make the researchers aware of current trends in different fields, learn about the research conducted in different areas and help them discuss new trends and encourage interdisciplinary research. Therefore, the theme of the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 is “Interdisciplinary Research in Education”. Highlighting this theme does not mean underestimating or neglecting other important aspects of educational research and practice.
The ERPA International Congresses on Education will publish an “ e-book of abstracts with ISBN ” and “ e-book of full texts with ISBN ”. Meanwhile, selected proceedings will be sent to the journal of SHS Web of Conferences for publication (if the authors request and pay the publication fee). ERPA 2015 and ERPA 2016 issues that are published in SHS Web of Conferences have already indexed in ISI Web of Knowledge . Meanwhile, ERPA 2014 issue that was published in the journal of Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences was also indexed in ISI Web of Knowledge . These proceedings should be well-written in terms of language use (the language of proceedings is English) and should be 5 to 8 pages in length. In addition, some selected proceedings can be referred for the publication in the journals that supporting the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018. In that case the authors should obey the publishers’ rules.
Thanks for your consideration and we look forward to meeting all of you in Istanbul / Turkey.
Best regards,
Organizing Committee of ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018

162229	Media Services : Spam	New Release from Atlantic Pubslishing	Book Spotlight of the week:
              Childhood Trauma and the Non-Alpha Male
   Retail Price - $24.95 * Paperback ISBN: 9781620235980 * E-Book: 9781620235997



The social perception of masculinity is very black and white — one is either an Alpha Male or a Beta Male, and there can be no variation. However, this is not the reality of masculinity in today’s society. Non-Alpha Males exist somewhere in the middle of the masculinity spectrum and are far more common than most people realize.


These Non-Alpha Males are prone to developmental and behavioral issues caused by gender role conflict, toxic shame, and complex trauma. These, as well as the role of parenting, attachment and abuse issues, gender constructs and socialization, and the resulting addiction, sexual issues, and self-loathing, are explored in “Childhood Trauma and the Non-Alpha Male”.


Dr. Carpenter’s book offers healthy resolutions through self-acceptance and psychological health. With stories of experiences from actual Non-Alpha Male clients bringing the theoretical into reality, “Childhood Trauma and the Non-Alpha Male” helps offer healing through hope, clarity, healing, and change.

 A Piece Of My Mind

                                             
                                             What is it like to nearly lose your life, along with everything else that gives you your unique identity? And, what is it like working your way back, seemingly against all odds? Actor, writer, director and professor Eric Barr developed an infection after open-heart surgery that triggered a series of devastating strokes, robbing him of speech, movement and all of his future plans. But it didn't rob him of hope.  
                                             
                                            In this moving documentary, Eric Barr is back to tell the tale. Filmed during a live performance of Eric's one-man show, A Piece of My Mind takes viewers on his incredible journey from near-death to recovery and reinvention. It is a celebration of life, love and the human spirit.

 I Am An Artist

                                             
                                             I Am An Artist tells the story of the often hidden children of our times-students with learning disabilities. The film follows several junior and high school students with Down's syndrome, autism, or mental health issues issues who collaborate with their dedicated art teacher to create artwork for their first big art gallery exhibition.

                                             
                                            The documentary offers an inside view into life at a special needs school by following the kids to their prom, field day and senior trip. The heart of the film lies with the art teacher, Mary Jo, whose unwavering enthusiasm and support for her students show that children with learning disabilities can achieve more growth than most people believe possible.

                                 Into The Trenches
                                 The provocatively titled documentary Director Jacob Fadley becomes the center of this deeply personal documentary that explores the complex nature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As a veteran struggling with feelings of self-hatred, Jacob begins to unearth his own personal ordeals and uncovers the prevalence of childhood trauma among members of the military.

                                 
                                Into The Trenches sides with a new movement among psychologists and counselors that see posttraumatic stress not as a disorder but as a natural phenomenon of being exposed to highly stressing events...

                                 The resilience and courage of a young man whose traumatic childhood caused him to go blind compels filmmaker Caisy Lun on a painful and rewarding journey of personal healing and growth, which begins with finally confronting her father about their relationship...

The HomeTech Building Analysis Report
The home inspection report form you use is just as vital as the flashlight you carry while getting your job done successfully. No matter how thorough your home inspection or how vast your technical knowledge, if your customer and their agent don't easily understand your report, you're out of business!

HomeTech Publishing would like to introduce you to the most widely used and respected home inspection report in the industry today - The HomeTech Building Analysis Report.

Every year over 100,000 home inspections are written using this easy to use, easy to understand report - that's more reports than our two biggest competitors sell combined! Our report is 20 pages long with 3 NCR copies. And unlike other systems that are comprised of loose sets of NCR paper, the HomeTech Building Analysis Report comes fully assembled and covered with a glossy, full color cover.

The BAR has nine tabbed sections that follow the natural flow of the home inspection and also includes four different pre-inspection agreement forms to choose from.
* Summary
* Structural and Basement
* Heating and Cooling
* Plumbing and Bathroom
* Electrical and Kitche
* Interior and Attic
* Roofing System and Exterior
* Grounds
* Remarks

Custom Branded Cover Design & Company Information Imprinting
HomeTech Publishing can fully customize your BAR cover graphics and pre-inspection agreement page for your business. It can be as simple as adding your company name, address and phone number to the outside cover or as complex as fully branding it with your own logo, images, corporate colors and custom graphics. Our in-house graphic design team can handle any request you may have. Do you have a sentence that you always add by hand to the pre-inspection agreement? We can add that for you and customize your page with any information you need to make your process smooth and easy to manage

HomeTech Publishing offers 3 levels of customization to our Building Analysis Reports on orders of 100 or more.
* Level 1 - FREE imprinting of your company information on the pre-inspection page
* Level 2 - Custom imprinting of your company information on the cover for an additional $2.00 ea.
* Level 3 - Fully branded custom cover with your logo, company colors and graphics for an additional $2.00 ea. + one time graphic design charge

If you would like to add custom imprinting or cover design please call our sales team at 800.240.8210.
Do you want a more professional logo and look for your business? HomeTech Publishing’s design team can help you create the perfect brand for your business. We can design and print all of your marketing materials such as brochures, direct mail, magnets, pocket folders and many more pieces that will help you stand out from the crowd.

Subject: Racial Climate Campus Forum Diagram

Good afternoon,

Please find the diagram of the arena attached for next week’s forum. The diagram doesn’t include the lobby area, but could we also have 2 tables in the lobby for refreshments?

Would it be possible to open the bleachers and ropes off those sections until they are needed? Also, for the handicap seating, could the space be left open (i.e. no chair)? I will bring signs for handicap seating.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you!
Caeli

                                            In today’s digital world, we are exposed to so much content on a daily basis that visual expectations are increasing while attention spans are shrinking. As you scroll through the latest red carpet arrivals to see who is best dressed, it’s easy to forget how those pictures made their way to your screen in a matter of seconds.  
                                              
                                            This talk will take you behind-the-scenes of the entire journey, from when the photographer arrives at the event to the photograph being published. The process starts on-site hours before the show begins, with the setting up of advanced tethering technology and the photographer being assigned a specific position. Once the event starts and the photos begin to be captured, the media journey begins. In a matter of seconds the magazine photo editor receives the images and decisions are made with the editor as to what goes up quickly and what is to be saved for the next day.

Let HomeTech Publishing Help You Get Those Estimates Off Your Desk And In Your Customers Hands!
------------------------------------------------------------

You can estimate any custom home in less time than ever before — with the completely updated HomeTech Publishing Housebuilders Cost Estimator!
Take a minute now and ask yourself these 3 questions:
Are you spending too much time figuring estimates?
Are you sure that subcontractor estimates are accurate?
Are inaccurate estimates robbing you of profits?
If you answered YES to any of these questions, then it's time to put the HomeTech Publishing Housebuilders Cost Estimator to work for you!

Here are just a few of the many features that make the HomeTech Publishing Housebuilders Estimator the most popular on the market today:
UP-TO-DATE UNIT COSTS — Every item in the book has been researched to bring you the most up-to-date costs — thousands of items specifically researched for custom home building. Every cost printed in the book you order is specific to your local area — no other estimating system can deliver that kind of accuracy!
LATEST MATERIAL & INNOVATIONS — Throughout the year we research new products and building techniques, making sure that the items you need for your estimate are always available.
EXCLUSIVE HOMETECH PUBLISHING CATEGORIES — Our 25 categories are organized in the same order you would build the project. HomeTech Publishing doesn't lump a big portion of what you do under a non-specific category such as "wood & plastics". Our categories are more specific, and include sections like site work, framing, concrete, excavation, plumbing, and electrical.
The HomeTech Publishing Housebuilders Cost Estimator is more than a reference book — it's an entire estimating system. It's a system that lets you estimate complete houses in minutes, quickly double-check subcontractor bids, and get fast, easy access to labor and material costs for virtually every house you'll ever build!
TOLL-FREE TELEPHONE SUPPORT — Every year our customers call us with countless questions — and we answer each and every one of them! With the purchase of the HomeTech Housebuilders Cost Estimator, we welcome your calls on our toll-free help line.
Most importantly, the edition you receive has been researched specifically for the area you work in. And as you well know when you're estimating a custom home, accuracy is everything!

Let HomeTech Publishing Help You Get Those Estimates Off Your Desk And In Your Customers Hands!

Our HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator will give the ability to price small jobs (under $4000) with the speed and accuracy HomeTech Publishing products have been delivering for over 50 years. This comprehensive system is laid out the same as the HomeTech Publishing Remodeling & Renovation Cost Estimator with the same 25 divisions from Plans and Permits to final Clean-up.

A major feature of the HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator is that most of the items show the cost for a minimum sized job as well as costs for the same work in a large quantity. As all hands-on contractors know, there is preparation work required on every job — and sometimes on a smaller job there will be more time spent on preparation than actually performing the work!
Every contractor has customers who want them to perform small jobs for them — replacing sidewalks, repairing steps, installing locksets, fixing leaky plumbing — but until now there was not a good way to price this work AND MAKE MONEY!
When you complete a medium to large scale remodeling project and satisfy the homeowner, you create a customer for life. But when will they remodel again?
Many successful remodelers have discovered there is profit to be made in handyman work. Some even have separate divisions that only do handyman work — with most of the work performed for previously satisfied remodeling customers!
The HomeTech Publishing Handyman Maintenance & Repair Cost Estimator contains page after page of items that will give you accurate costs for virtually any small job your customer wants!
Every item contains a full description and is broken down to exact labor cost, material cost, total cost and sales price to the customer.

ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018
[1] www.erpacongress.com
Dear Colleague,
It is with great pleasure to inform you about the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 that will be held in Istanbul / Turkey from 28 June to 1 July 2018 ( [2] www.erpacongress.com ). We hope that the conference will enable you to share your research with an international research community and to engage in discussion about the current issues in the field of education. We want you to remember ERPA International Congresses on Education as a place where you discussed the issues and questions that count for your research, renewed relations with your colleagues and made contacts that helped you to develop new directions in your work. Congress languages are English and Turkish.
Ten branch congresses will be held concurrently in ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018;
 - ERPA International Educational Sciences Congress
 - ERPA International Science and Mathematics Education Congress
 - ERPA International Social Sciences Education Congress
 - ERPA International Health and Sports Science Education Congress
 - ERPA International Music and Fine Arts Education Congress
 - ERPA International Special Education Congress
 - ERPA International Computer Education and Instructional Technology Congress
 - ERPA International Language Education Congress
 - ERPA International Management of Education Congress
 - ERPA International Engineering and Architecture Education Congress
While registering the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 you will be asked to choose the one that is related to your field of study. The main purpose in incorporating ten congresses within the scope of ERPA International Congresses on Education is to make the researchers aware of current trends in different fields, learn about the research conducted in different areas and help them discuss new trends and encourage interdisciplinary research. Therefore, the theme of the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018 is “Interdisciplinary Research in Education”. Highlighting this theme does not mean underestimating or neglecting other important aspects of educational research and practice.
The ERPA International Congresses on Education will publish an “ e-book of abstracts with ISBN ” and “ e-book of full texts with ISBN ”. Meanwhile, selected proceedings will be sent to the journal of SHS Web of Conferences for publication (if the authors request and pay the publication fee). ERPA 2015 and ERPA 2016 issues that are published in SHS Web of Conferences have already indexed in ISI Web of Knowledge . Meanwhile, ERPA 2014 issue that was published in the journal of Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences was also indexed in ISI Web of Knowledge . These proceedings should be well-written in terms of language use (the language of proceedings is English) and should be 5 to 8 pages in length. In addition, some selected proceedings can be referred for the publication in the journals that supporting the ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018. In that case the authors should obey the publishers’ rules.
Thanks for your consideration and we look forward to meeting all of you in Istanbul / Turkey.
Best regards,
Organizing Committee of ERPA International Congresses on Education 2018

174576	Media Services : Spam	Changes to YouTube’s Terms of Service	<https://www.youtube.com>

We’re updating our Terms of Service <https://www.youtube.com/t/terms>   
(“Terms”) to improve readability and transparency. This update does not   
change the Google Privacy Policy <https://policies.google.com/privacy>, nor   
the way we collect and process your data.

We’ve provided a summary of key changes   
<https://www.youtube.com/t/terms?preview=20191210#summary> but here’s what   
you can expect:

• Terms that are clearer and easier to understand with useful links to help   
you navigate YouTube and better understand our policies.

• Expanded commitments to notify you about changes that may affect you,   
such as product updates or future changes to the Terms; and

• Better alignment between our Terms and how YouTube works today.

The new Terms will take effect on 10 December, 2019. Please make sure you   
read the updated Terms  
<https://www.youtube.com/t/terms?preview=20191210#main> carefully. If you

174750	Media Services : Spam	Important changes coming to YouTube; you need to take action	<https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFnwnKVZRsBef5uFHVbGcw4SfnAHjBrPBRWsckuFglHZpm0fuEUfhmYSHpNj8C5JFcfJKMKXI0l9xDlBScDZkDPzuHaHY24jwks2saGjNXqEAKmsGdoRaO1EiYCOl1ZbUmXBwvM>

Hi Media Services,

Important changes that may impact your monetization and content   
discoverability are coming.

Starting today, all creators are required to tell us if their content is   
made for kids in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy   
Protection Act (COPPA) and/or other applicable laws. To help you comply, we   
are introducing a new audience setting in YouTube Studio   
<https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFnwnKXxM4Q-jKHEoPHlZHosGjefsnoWTTrDcW4p6QtxZkbKA5uLTkRZ0lgr34K6MqPDFGpq3pb2sBEqu8bPDfzWToFaQrOKT6fV8m7VVHWPPzXdPl6ncGmuGZC0kAjwL_hNQQO6vYbYqSnjYXJ8civUeg>.

Depending on the amount of made for kids content on your channel, you can   
set your audience at either the channel level or the video level. For those   
who are setting at the channel level, it is just one click.

These changes are required as part of a settlement with the US Federal   
Trade Commission (FTC) and NY Attorney General, and will help you comply   
with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and/or other   
applicable laws.

We know that these changes won’t be easy for some creators, and that this   
required change is going to take some time getting used to. But these are   
important steps to take to ensure compliance with the law.

Please read more below to understand your legal obligations and the impact   
these choices may have on your channel.

What is changing?

Starting today, all creators are required to mark their content as made for   
kids or not made for kids in YouTube Studio.

Starting in January: we will limit the data we collect on made for kids   
content to comply with the law. This means we will disable personalized ads   
on this content (which affects revenue for creators making content for   
kids), as well as certain features like comments, notifications and others.   
Note: You may see some small changes as we experiment and refine our   
systems over the next few months.

For a list of affected features, go here   
<https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFnwnKXzDjVYCE4LScFww1t-InahOCtWO71kY-XYyEozFbhAdkOxZqPkkN3ddx2JZjesWM_auo8ayk-ahLNRcqi7E1WEUXB-53FCJq1cDRY69f-2Ab7I1JOYtuP9JFDulXoEAzAyn_R4T9QchwmaXKJNeQ>.

Why is this happening?

These changes are required as part of a settlement with the US Federal   
Trade Commission (FTC) and NY Attorney General, and will help you comply   
with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and/or other   
applicable laws.

Regardless of your location, we are required to ask you to set your videos   
as made for kids if they fall into that category, please make these   
settings as soon as possible.

We’ll also use machine learning systems to help us find content that is   
clearly made for kids. But do not rely on our systems to set content for   
you -- like all automated systems, ours are not perfect.

If you don’t set your content or if we detect error or abuse, we may set   
your audience for you. If you fail to set your content accurately you may   
face compliance issues with the FTC or other authorities, and we may take   
action on your YouTube account.

What is “made for kids” content?

We cannot provide specific legal advice, but according to the FTC’s   
guidance on COPPA, a video is child directed (which we call “made for   
kids”) if:

- It is directed to children as the primary audience (e.g. videos for   
preschoolers).

- It is directed to children but children are a secondary audience (e.g.   
cartoon video that primarily targets  teenagers but is also intended for   
younger kids).

Learn more about the factors that determine if your content is considered   
as made for kids here  
<https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFnwnKWwBrkiWhDN51hpmkxnhmDVYHJuXUuXg8XCQxlI8SgCbo0lgo-ESXkLp22a-Kpj6Muwu8unAYmNHldTLuN8WCvjlZG0GpB_Mb0MAMDxOG7PXUEaDOjjfRXElKpPmw1hoZo>.

We know this won’t be easy for some creators, and that this required change   
is going to take some getting used to. While we cannot provide legal   
advice, we are committed to helping you through this transition.

Hi Salar,



Correct, each classroom is equipped with an instructor computer/ internet access. However, you are more than welcome to bring your laptop and plug in that way.

Dear Ruby,



I will be using the power point slides and lecture notes that are available on CENGAGE for the upcoming course. I was wondering what devices are available in class to accommodate the downloading and presenting the slides to the class. I'm assuming there is a computer and overhead projector. Will I be able to access the internet to download the course material online?



Please advise.



Best,

175352	Media Services : Spam	Resource Suggestion	Hi Callutheran Team,

This is Manuel from DrugRehab.com and I am reaching out on behalf of our
sister site, The Recovery Village Ridgefield (RidgefieldRecovery.com).

Many veterans struggle with stress and mental illness, which increases
their risk for developing substance use disorders. Our goal is to spread
awareness of substance misuse and to be an informational resource for those
impacted by alcohol and drug dependence.

I believe that our information would be a great resource to share on your
page, http://www.callutheran.edu/veterans/resources/outside-resources.html

Please feel free to review our veteran's information page:

161362	Media Services : Spam	[Action required] Support has ended for MacOS X 10.9 operating systems	Hi Carlos,

Dropbox has ended support for Mac OS X 10.9 today. Unfortunately we noticed that you still have device(s) running this unsupported operating system.

You have now been signed out of device(s) still running Mac OS X 10.9. Unsupported devices will no longer have access to the Dropbox desktop application.

What to do next:
To continue without interruption, we recommend that you update to Mac OS X 10.10 or higher. For more information about updating your operating system visit Apple’s website[1] .

You can find which connected device(s) are running Mac OS X 10.9 by visiting the “Security” section of your account page[2] and scrolling to the bottom.

Don’t worry—your files won’t go anywhere. In addition to supported Mac operating systems, you can still access your files from supported Windows, iOS and Android apps, or via dropbox.com[3] .

We apologize for any inconvenience. For additional system requirement information, please see our help center[4] .

Best,
- The Dropbox Team

168733	Media Services : Spam	Updates to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy	Hi Carlos,

We’re constantly looking for ways to improve the Dropbox experience. This year we’ve announced new features[1] , partnerships[2] , and the acquisition of HelloSign[3] . To support these improvements, we’ve made a few updates to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Here’s a summary of the key additions:  
 - Terms of Service . On June 11, we unveiled the new Dropbox. Our mission is to offer a robust collaboration workspace that helps users find, retrieve, organize, and prioritize their files, collaborate with others, and stay focused on their most important work. To better align with that mission and the new Dropbox, our revised Terms outline that our Services provide “features like commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews, optical character recognition (OCR), easy sorting and organization, and personalization to help reduce busywork.” We’ve also revised our beta terms to include a confidentiality provision and to allow Dropbox to solicit feedback from beta participants.
 - Privacy Policy . We’ve updated our Privacy Policy to include more details on what personal data we collect and how we use it. For instance, our Privacy Policy now explains how Dropbox shares data with companies that it acquires (like HelloSign) and other ecosystem partners[4] that offer integrations for Dropbox users. We’ve also revised our Privacy Shield attestation so that data transfers from the UK to the US will continue to be covered by our Privacy Shield certification if the UK leaves the European Union.

 You can read the full Terms of Service[5] and Privacy Policy[6] , which will go into effect on September 24th, 2019. You can also find our previous Terms here[7] . For more details, visit our Help Center[8] .

Thanks!
- The Dropbox Team

Take a minute now and ask yourself these 3 questions:
1. Are you spending too much time figuring estimates?

If you answered YES to any of these questions it's time to put the HomeTech Publishing Remodeling & Renovation Cost Estimator to work for you!

Our research staff contacts thousands of local suppliers to give you pin-point accuracy in material costs.We track labor costs for multiple factors in over 250 different areas of the US & Canada so your costs will be competitive with other successful remodelers in your local area.This gives you the power to sell remodeling projects based on value,not price.That's the best way to make a profit!

Good afternoon,

Does Campus Services communicate with Facilities to ensure the A/C is programmed to be on when an event is scheduled, or should we contact Facilities separately?  I am inquiring on behalf of professor Jim Bond, for poet Dana Gioia's talk tomorrow beginning at 4 pm in Samuelson Chapel.

Thank you,

The HomeTech Building Analysis Report
The home inspection report form you use is just as vital as the flashlight you carry while getting your job done successfully. No matter how thorough your home inspection or how vast your technical knowledge, if your customer and their agent don't easily understand your report, you're out of business!

HomeTech Publishing would like to introduce you to the most widely used and respected home inspection report in the industry today - The HomeTech Building Analysis Report.

Every year over 100,000 home inspections are written using this easy to use, easy to understand report - that's more reports than our two biggest competitors sell combined! Our report is 20 pages long with 3 NCR copies. And unlike other systems that are comprised of loose sets of NCR paper, the HomeTech Building Analysis Report comes fully assembled and covered with a glossy, full color cover.

The BAR has nine tabbed sections that follow the natural flow of the home inspection and also includes four different pre-inspection agreement forms to choose from.
* Summary
* Structural and Basement
* Heating and Cooling
* Plumbing and Bathroom
* Electrical and Kitche

Is Cold Calling Really Dead?
****************************

Some people think that cold calling is dead, ineffective and a
waste of time. Some people think that cold calling is an
efficient use of time, effective and very much alive. Of course,
survey companies have conducted various studies throughout
different organizations with the intention to produce empirical
data, statistics, reports and case studies to deliver a
definitive answer to the question: is cold calling really dead?

Hi Media Services,

Last September, we announced  
<https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFnwnKUjn5W0HqWw-jpNHEsEDobJF798mk2o-bXmrDJu_C6B5eksz-nj4Vp7BFxohKie9kvm0QDURzUu-IzUDEjLy1tq0H-6ohtMl112NXuHZ_bPVQPLq3EFbvnsYwCDT9L60efgGDvVbGwbCVry6x_iN2WuZaujhnSCRsIJEKmtQIVuabo>   
a series of changes that we’d be making to better protect kids and their   
privacy on YouTube, and to address the concerns raised to us by the U.S.   
Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Specifically, that all creators would be required to designate their   
content as made for kids or not made for kids in YouTube Studio, and that   
personal information from anyone watching a video designated as made for   
kids would be treated as coming from a child, regardless of the age of the   
user.

Starting today, we will no longer serve personalized ads or support   
features such as comments, Stories, live chat, notification bell, and   
others  
<https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFnwnKXGYDLSXWYu1mAXDnS5nHYSUcVI5tlwhAfIQ17FGF_Tv-Y3Xsqy0u9JZ_l19Wi2lyDRz-_RHUBaSrFPZXBbHKkV7n91cKVwdt-7yM3TsyVxWo5qqJsh1LuWIMaHHrBOUldbXbWWM4j_3zwZ2eip6b5NPm3dvXYwUSGg4bpPXncTQabkhkPfWgSpaUmyVQ>   
on videos designated made for kids.

We know these changes may have significant impact on creators making kids   
content, so we’re committed to helping them navigate this new landscape. We   
continue to engage on this issue, including by participating in the FTC's   
open comment period. We know many creators have provided valuable feedback   
as well.

Is Cold Calling Really Dead?
****************************

Some people think that cold calling is dead, ineffective and a
waste of time. Some people think that cold calling is an
efficient use of time, effective and very much alive. Of course,
survey companies have conducted various studies throughout
different organizations with the intention to produce empirical
data, statistics, reports and case studies to deliver a
definitive answer to the question: is cold calling really dead?

181149	Media Services : Spam	Re: Biggest Little Farm details for next month	Yes, we are planning on farmstand at the event from 6-7pm before the film. We were also thinking of having some students at the table after the film as well to field inquiries about SEEd. We can request a table and go from there. I am CCing our student special event manager, Jacob Schleien, who will work on setting this up.

Subject: Biggest Little Farm details for next month

Hello all:

The screening of The Biggest Little Farm is coming up in less than a month – Friday, March 20, 7 pm.  John Chester, the farmer and filmmaker, is planning on staying for a 45 minute Q & A after the film. His contract specified from 8:30-9:15pm – so I don’t think we could get him on a tour of the garden prior to the start of the screening, so I am focusing on what we can do:

A few details as we get closer to our date:

  1.  Sam – are you willing to introduce the film and facilitate the Q& A after the screening? I thought this would be an appropriate time to talk about the SEED program and maybe even do an “ask” for donations if you feel this is appropriate.
  2.  Lala – I know the Chester’s also have a children’s book out about one of the stars of the show, Saving Emma the Pig<https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Emma-Biggest-Little-Farm/dp/1250187796>, I am not sure if you want to request a copy of it for display, etc., but if you do, my contact at Apricot Lane Farms is:

apricotlanefarms.com<https://apricotlanefarms.com?utm_source=email_signature&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=general_signature>




  1.  Kristin – Are you able to have the SEED garden students there with a “farmers market” and the bee group, too? In our last meeting I have noted that  you were willing to do this. We have gotten a lot of interest from the community – so I would love to have this type of student showcase going on as members of the community arrive. Do you need me to request permission to  have those groups  around the “Gumby” area or will you and the students handle that?
  2.  Cynthia – I think I shared this link with you before for the promo materials: https://neon.app.box.com/s/pikdt2zav35j2fs5tgculusnapty9a42  - but if there is anything else you need, let me know.
  3.  Media Services: I have submitted the request for a BlueRay player and two mics for the Q & A following. Who will be staffing the event that night in case we have technical difficulties?
  4.  All – I have rec’d many inquiries re: the show from the community. They all wanted to know where to reserve tickets. When I explain to them that there are not tickets – it is first-come, first seated – most are OK, but I have a woman who is bringing elderly folks who wants to know how early she can get there to reserve 8-10 places for her group (The Italian American Club) – as they want to attend as a club event. Thoughts on this?? Cynthia – you might have the most experience with this type of request. I’d appreciate some guidance.
  5.  Prior to the start of the semester, I  sent an email to 21 faculty who teach topics related to sustainability or film – informing them about the event and encouraging them to add it to their syllabi – some have done so, but please encourage your colleagues to have students attend.

I am sure there are other items I am missing – as I am not typically an events planner on campus – so please speak up if I am missing a task/opportunity connected with this event.

Many thanks for you collaboration!

160512	Media Services : Spam	COMPLIMENTARY TICKETS - orchestra concert Saturday March 30 in Santa Barbara!	Dear teachers,

We’re very happy to offer complimentary tickets to all teachers, parents,
and students to a special performance by the Kaleidoscope Chamber Orchestra
<http://www.kco.la/> on Saturday March 30th at 7 PM at Music Academy of the
West, 1070 Fairway Road Santa Barbara, CA 93108.


Kaleidoscope is a professional conductorless orchestra based in Los Angeles
and this is our first time performing in Santa Barbara. LA Times recently
did a front page story about us
<https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-kaleidoscope-chamber-orchestra-20190213-story.html>
and we’ve also been reviewed in the Washington Post, Huffington Post, and
elsewhere.

We have a limited number of complementary tickets we can offer and will
reserve them on a first come basis. To reserve one or more tickets, please
send a list of names by Friday March 29 to: alexgranger@kco.la

Reserved complimentary tickets will be available to pick up before the
performance at our box office under each person’s name.


This performance features an orchestra of over 60 of the country’s leading
musicians performing Debussy's La Mer, Prokofiev’s 1st Violin Concerto with
Andrea Obiso, and string orchestra works by Hildegard von Bingen and
Michael Gilbertson. To watch videos from past concerts, visit our website
at:


www.kco.la/videos


To watch a video of Andrea performing the Prokofiev Violin Concerto that
we're performing with him this Saturday, click here:

Tickets for this concert range from $25-$55 and can also be purchased at:

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/kaleidoscope-chamber-orchestra-performs-in-santa-barbara-saturday-march-30-tickets-55447891135


Money raised through ticket sales or donations helps support our musicians
and programming which includes over 60 free concerts each year at title I
schools, hospitals, and homeless shelters. However, we don’t want the
ticket price to be a barrier for anyone and are happy to offer
complimentary tickets on a first come basis.


We would be very grateful for your help forwarding this info to colleagues,
parents, and students that might be interested in attending. We want
everyone to feel welcome and to share this beautiful music with as many
people as possible.

Thank you in advance for your help and we hope to see you on Saturday the
30th!


Ben

PS. we also have another performance on Sunday the 31st in Santa Monica.

Hi there,

My name is Melody Wachtel and I am a Programs Board representative on
campus. I am running a Spring Concert event on March 27 from 4-7 and wanted
to ask you a question about equipment that is not on the event contract. Do
you have ear pieces so that the artist singing can actually hear
themselves? Please let me know, thank you.

178825	Media Services : Repairs	Projector	Hi,


I'm showing a PowerPoint presentation today, and the colors are off.  Reds are black, and greens are yellow.  That means that the students cannot see anything that is in red!!  Could it be the bulb?  I have adjusted all of the color adjustments, so it's not that.

171104	Media Services : Repairs	William Rolland Art Center, Room 212	Hi,
I teach a film class in William Rolland Art Center, Room 212 on Thurs. evenings.   
Two weeks ago, when I played a bluray everything worked perfectly, but last week, the bluray player kept flickering and skipping — there was static every so often.  It seems like it might be a connection issue.
Can someone check the bluray player to confirm that everything is plugged in properly?
I sent an email last week but never heard back.
Thank you,
Nico

I was advise to contact Media Services with my request below.
Please check room speakers in Peters Hall 106. Speakers did not work for a couple of weeks now; or, perhaps, they are not properly connected.
I would really appreciate if you could fix them by Thursday, November 21. We'll need sound for Thursday's presentations.

Have a great day!

The media equipment in classroom Humanities 114 did not work again for the third time. A student of mine who works for Media Services, at the end of class, suggested I push the "Mute" button to make the computer to appear on the overhead projector. Should I do this or is something malfunctioning and needs to be addressed by your office. Pressing this button is not something I have done in the past.... I really appreciate your assistance!


Thank you and best wishes,
